# The licenses of our childhood

This project was realized with the help of two different APIs where I had to display data, use the data, manipulate them ...

## What i need to get started
<hr>

Javascript

2 different APIs : 

[Disney API](https://disneyapi.dev/docs)

[Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

## Use
<hr>

For the good functioning of the project you will just have to go on [Link](). On the site you will find 2 logos, the **Disneyland** logo and the **Rick and Morty** logo in the navbar, then move your mouse over the card of the desired character.

Just click on the logo of your choice to find the information corresponding to the desired universe. About the part **Disneyland** you will see the first appearance of the desired character.

And for the **Rick et Morty** part the information displayed are ***name***, ***status (alive or dead or unknown)***, ***planet of residence*** and ***species name***.
